Problem Statement:
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.
AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.
The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

Findings:
The metrics like OT%, IF%, OTIF% are far behind the set target.
Orders are delayed 0.69 days from the agreed date of delivery on an average.
Lotus Mart, Coolblue, Acclaimed stores have the highest orders, also the most to deliver the products on time
Ghee, curd and butter products are most delayed to get delivered.
There is a huge gap in IF% for most of the customers.
